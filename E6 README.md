OBJECTIVE : Submit a link to a github page that contains the solution but also use markdown to explain in detail what you do in each section (hint to take the most of the explanation: try using LaTeX to write equations in your markdown code; hint to show the simplex tableau as you pregress: 

Consider a LP problem

1) write the dual LP problem
2) verify that  $Q=(x_1,x_2,x_3)=(0,52.5,20)$ is a feasible solution for the primal
3) Use CS to determine a candidate solution to the dual.
4) Is $Q$ the solution for the primal problem?
