# E1-Creating-github-repo-and-testing-python-code

This repository contains python implementations of two algorithms : 
1. a naive implementation of the traveling salesman problem : It helps us to find the shortest route that visits each city  once and that returns to the original city.
2. a backtracking and recursive approach to solve the subset sum problem : It helps find out if we can make a specific sum by adding up some of the numbers from a given list.

Besides the README file, there are four additional files: for both algorithms we can find the code and its corresponding graph.
