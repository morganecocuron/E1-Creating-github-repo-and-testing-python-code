Build a code that uses the branch and bound algorithm to solve a general integer problem. Apply the code to solve this specific problem:

An applied research lab has a collection of knowledge transfer projects to choose from and a limited amount of researcher days. The principal investigator wants to find the optimal strategy about which problems they should take (xi=1) and which they should discard (xi=0).

The following table shows the revenues each project has and the number of researcher days each will require:

Project	1	2	3	4	5	6
Revenue	15	20	5	25	22	17
Days	51	60	40	62	63	10
