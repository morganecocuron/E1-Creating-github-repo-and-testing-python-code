Build a jupyter notebook that implements:

1) Read an external file containing the parameters of a transportation problem LP problem
2) Different methods can be used to find the initial feasible solution for the problem:
    Northwest corner rule
    Minimum cost method
    Minimum Row cost method
    Vogel's method
3) the transportation simplex algorithm in an arbitrary transportation problem.
